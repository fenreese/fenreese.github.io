Hiya! I'm *Reese*. I'm a language enthusiast, \*nix-based OS lover, and computer science student based in Ontario, Canada.

I enjoy attending hackathons and exploring new technologies. Currently, I've been playing around with virtual reality games using the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/products/unity-engine), as well as general programming with [Python](https://www.python.org/). I also enjoy using [Arch (btw) Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and make sure all of my code editors have [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) keybindings.

In my free time, I listen to a lot of music (electropop, hardcore, and cloud rap specifically) and play a lot of rhythm games (Pump it Up, DanceDanceRevolution, Beat Saber). I also try to read books and learn Japanese (the key word here is *try*).

You can reach me via email (*hi at this domain*) and LinkedIn, but I prefer checking email.
