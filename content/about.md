Hiya! I'm *Reese*. I'm also around on the internet as *Renys* (pronounce that like "ren knees", also *Ren* is okay). I'm a data enthusiast, \*nix-based OS lover, and computer science student based in Ontario, Canada.

I like ensuring my work is as great as can possibly be, experimenting with technologies, and going to hackathons. I've particularly taken a liking to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [(Arch btw) Linux](https://archlinux.org/). 

In my free time, I'm a big fan of K-pop girl group [aespa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aespa). I also play a bit of VR games (mostly Beat Saber) when I can ~~but I haven't been able to lately because I've challenged myself to limit my computer time on Windows.~~

You can reach me via email (*hi at this domain*) and LinkedIn, but I prefer checking email.
