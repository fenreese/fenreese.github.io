# hiya! i'm reese.

i'm a language enthusiast, \*nix-based OS lover, and computer science graduate based in Ontario, Canada.

# what i do

i enjoy attending hackathons and exploring new technologies. currently, i've been playing around with virtual reality games using the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/products/unity-engine), as well as general programming with [Python](https://www.python.org/). i also enjoy using [Arch (btw) Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and make sure all of my code editors have [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) keybindings.

in my free time, i listen to a lot of music (electropop, hardcore, and cloud rap specifically) and play a lot of rhythm games (Pump it Up, DanceDanceRevolution, Beat Saber). i also try to read books and learn Japanese (the key word here is *try*).

# contact me

You can reach me via email (*hi at this domain*) and LinkedIn, but I prefer checking email.
